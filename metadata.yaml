description: "Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress\
  \ upon Human Life and Thought, generally known as Anticipations, was written by\
  \ H.G. Wells at the age of 34. He later called the book, which became a bestseller,\
  \ \"the keystone to the main arch of my work.\" His most recent biographer, however,\
  \ calls the volume \"both the starting point and the lowest point in Wells's career\
  \ as a social thinker.\"\nTaking the revolution in transport facilitated by the\
  \ \"mechanical revolution\" as his point of departure, Wells told readers they were\
  \ living through a reorganization of human society that would alter every dimension\
  \ of life. An academic biographer has described the degree of accuracy of Wells's\
  \ predictions as \"certainly phenomenal.\"\nThe chapters of Anticipations appeared\
  \ in Great Britain in the Fortnightly Review (April–December 1901) and in the United\
  \ States in the North American Review (June–November 1901), and were published as\
  \ a book in November 1901. Anticipations was \"Wells's first non-fiction bestseller.\"\
  \ The volume was reissued by Chapman and Hall in 1914, on the eve of World War I.\n\
